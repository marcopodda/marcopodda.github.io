    <h2>Hello! I'm John Doe.</h2>
    <p>I am an academic researcher in Machine Learning with a strong focus on **Deep Learning for Computer Vision** and **Reinforcement Learning**. Currently, I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Department of Computer Science, University of Pisa, Italy.</p>

    <p>My work involves developing novel algorithms for image recognition, object detection, and sequential decision-making in complex environments. I am particularly interested in the intersection of neural network architectures and efficient learning strategies for real-world applications.</p>

    <p>Before joining the University of Pisa, I completed my PhD in Computer Science at XYZ University, where my research centered on interpretable machine learning models. I am always open to collaborations and discussing new ideas!</p>
